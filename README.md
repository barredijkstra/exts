Collection of random scala helpers that I generally use in my projects.

Feel free to use it in your own projects, but there are no real guarantees on stability, besides SemVer, or maintenance.
This project is mainly (or solely) targeted for use by myself.

## Usage
Are you sure you want to? Are you sure? Really?

If you really really want to, add the following to your sbt

```scala
 libraryDependencies += "nl.salp" %% "exts" % "x.y.z"
```

The project is cross-compiled against both Scala 2.11 and 2.12
